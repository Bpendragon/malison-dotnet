Malison is a small C# library for drawing old school ASCII terminals. I
harvested it from my roguelike game, [Amaranth][] and it's aimed at games with
ASCII graphics.

See [this][post] for more info.

I no longer actively maintain this. You are welcome to fork it, but I'm not
taking pull requests, fixing bugs, or hacking on it myself.
